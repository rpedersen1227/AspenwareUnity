      Whether or not to give a pro rata credit for the amount of time remaining
      between the `effectiveTime` and the end of the current period.

      In addition, if the `renewalTime` is retained (by setting the
      `renewalPolicy` to `retain`), then a pro rata debit will occur as well,

      for the amount between the `effectiveTime` and the `renewalTime` as a
      percentage of the normal period size.
    type: boolean
  effectiveTime:
    description: >-
