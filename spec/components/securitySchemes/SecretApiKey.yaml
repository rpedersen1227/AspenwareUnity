  When you sign up for an account, you are given your first secret API key.
  To do so please [follow this link.](https://app.rebilly.com/signup)
  Also you can generate additional API keys, and delete API keys (as you may
  need to rotate your keys in the future). All API keys can be restricted to a
  small set of permissions (restricted API keys).
